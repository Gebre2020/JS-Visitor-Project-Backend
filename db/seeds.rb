# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# location1 = Location.create(city: "Chicago", state: "IL, USA")
# location2 = Location.create(city: "Charlotte", state: "NC, USA")

# Trip.create(name: "Willis Tower", address: "233 S. Wacker Dr.", budget: 250.55, location: location1)
# Trip.create(name: "The Art Institute of Chicago", address: "111 S. Michigan Ave.",budget: 550.75, location: location1)
